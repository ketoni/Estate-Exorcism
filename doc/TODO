* SpellBookState
    - Create the state
    - Add contents and/or images
    - Needs the spells to be decided
    - Define how the game knows which spells the player has learned

* MonsterManualState
    - Create the state
    - Add contents and/or images
    - Needs the monsters to be decided
    - Define how the game knows which monsters the player has encountered

* LetterState
    - Create the state
    - Add contents and/or images
    - Define how the game knows which estates the player has cleared

* HomeState
    - Add buttons for spellbook, monster manual and the letters
    - Place correct sprites for each of them
    - Add borders or something to make them more visible
    - Add subtle background animations (ask if the cat is animated already)

* EstateState / RoomState
    ? Is this state a single room (RoomState?) and we transition to different new states like this?
    ? Or is an EstateState a whole level with different rooms which are generated by the state itself?
    - Create the state
    - Figure out transition between rooms (see above)
    (do these later:)
    - Monster spawning
    - Combat

* Monsters
    ? Should we have a Monster class which derives from GameObject or could we go without that
    ? How to implement behavior in GameObject alone? Some 'brain' component?
    ? What happens when they die?

* GameObject
    ? Can these interact other GameObjects directly (access GameObject vector) or just the State they're in?
    ? Can these create other GameObjects in the State they're in? Monsters creating other monsters or other stuff?
    - Best to create a spawn queue which state accesses on each update cycle, can be used to spawn other objects
    - Removal
    - "Do this before this object is destoryed"
    - Animations

* Player and gameplay
    ? Could the player even be a GameObject?
    ? What happens on death?
    - Controls

* Spells
    - Decide on spell types, elements and interactions

* Combat
    ? How does it actually work?
    ? Do you hit all monsters at once?

* Resources
    - Playing sound

* Music
    - Search for some
    - Compose a simple eerie background loop?

* Sound effects
    - Search for some
